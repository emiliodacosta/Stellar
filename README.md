# Welcome to the Stellar Message Board Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Install [json-server] (https://github.com/typicode/json-server/tree/v0) so you can use `db.json` as a database

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server@0.17.4
   ```

3. Start the back-end json-server

   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project where you will store a valid API KEY from Clerk for `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=` that I have provided you via email (contact me at emidac@gmail.com if you have any issues with this)

5. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

6. Make sure that you are running Expo in Expo Go mode, not development mode. As shown in the screenshot above, press `s` to toggle between these two modes.

7. For Android, you will additionally need to run the following command in which you provide the port number (in my case  `3000` as shown in the screenshot above) that your machine's `localhost` connects to when you start the `json-server`:

   ```bash
   adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000
   ```

## If successful, the mobile app should look like the screens below!
